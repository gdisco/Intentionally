# Intention Ally
Meditative Life Planner

Intention Ally helps you feel accomplished at the end of each day. It is not a fully featured todo app, but a way to overcome
distractions and build powerful goal-setting habits. It also prioritizes style over efficiency, using smooth animations to
encourage you to slow down and enjoy planning your day.

Start each morning in Intention Ally, choosing 3-5 tasks that you need to accomplish to feel good about yourself
at the end of the day. Once you've set your goals for the day, Intention Ally makes your 
list read-only. You can view and complete tasks, but you can't change them. Intention Ally thereby serves as a reminder of 
what's really important to you throughout your day. When urgent distractions demand your attention, your Intention Ally keeps
you true to your vision of who you want to be.

Of course, sometimes life throws curveballs and things have to change. That's why Intention Ally isn't a todo app. But every
completed task is another step away from an aimless life blown about by distractions, toward a life lived Intentionally.

Future features: Weekly and monthly goals, sharing goals with friends.
